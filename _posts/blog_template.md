   - Complex model evaluation

4. **Advanced Neural Networks (TensorFlow)**
   - Custom architectures
   - Callbacks
   - Basic optimization strategies

## Writing Style to Maintain

### 1. Structure
Each post should follow this format:
- Clear introduction stating learning objectives
- Problem setup and data preparation
- Step-by-step implementation
- Results analysis
- Summary and key takeaways
- Links to related posts in series

### 2. Code Presentation
- Start with imports and setup
- Break code into logical chunks
- Include detailed comments
- Show output/results where relevant
- Provide visualizations of results

### 3. Tone and Language
- Educational but professional
- Assume Python/TensorFlow basics
- Explain complex concepts simply
- Use analogies where helpful
- Include practical tips and warnings

### 4. Visual Elements
- Include relevant plots/diagrams
- Show model architectures
- Visualize training progress
- Display comparison tables
- Use consistent styling
