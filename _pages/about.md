**Data Scientist, Neuroscientist, Programmer (<a href="/michael/assets/pdf/CV_Notter.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>)**

I am a **research scientist** working at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, neuroscience, and knowledge transfer. I have strong scientific, analytical, teaching, and interpersonal **skills**, and experience working on challenging projects, both as a team member and project leader, collaborating with stakeholders from academia and industry. **My background** is in programming, numerical analysis, and systems modeling, with particular interest in the medical field and computer vision. **I enjoy** working in a stimulating and vibrant environment and have a knack for quality, efficiency, and transparency. **My passion** for my work stems from a general curiosity and deep desire to understand complex systems, and the wish to keep up with the potential of artificial intelligence.
