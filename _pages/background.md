## Professional Experience

<p style="font-size:0.85rem; margin-bottom: 0">2022 - present</p>
<p style="font-size:1.25rem; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Machine Learning Staff Engineer</b> · <i>ams OSRAM, Martigny</i></p>

As a researcher in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning team in the Innovation Office of <a href="https://ams-osram.com/">ams OSRAM</a>, I work on several projects in the field of computer vision and signal processing in general. I am using data from vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and combining it with advanced signal processing and machine learning routines to improve the performance, expand the capabilities, and reduce the resource requirements of next-generation 3D sensing and scene recognition applications. In particular, but not exclusively, I strive to improve the real-time capabilities of direct time-of-flight (dToF) and next-generation sensor technologies, such as self-mixing interferometry (SMI), to provide low-power, high measurement accuracy sensor technologies at very high speed.
